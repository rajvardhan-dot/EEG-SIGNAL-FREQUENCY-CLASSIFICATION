EEG signal is measurement of the electrical
activity is produced by the neurons network of the brain when
brain is made any mental task. The EEG signal is consist of
very low frequency components and amplitude so diff. types of
noises and artifacts are overlapping with EEG signal like as
base line wondering, eye blinking, eye movement, breathing
etc. EEG signal is complex signal. The doctors and medical
researchers are face or interact to great complications to
analysis these signals and extract the linear, non-linear
information from these biomedical signals. We are filtering the
EEG signal by using diff types of filters to remove the
unwanted frequency components from the original signal and
to extract the features or information about the signal with
the help of different efficient DSP tools like DFT, FFT, STFT and
wavelet transform. Here we are used the FIR band pass
Butterworth filter to filter the EEG signal and analysing this
filtered signal with the help of FFT. The lab view software tool
is used to this work it is easier to mat lab .software because
there is programming is not used in lab view
